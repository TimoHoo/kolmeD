# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#

# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites.
# You may change this to anything you like.
gem "minima", "~> 2.0"

# To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
# github pages gem is bundled with lots of other needed gems,
# see https://pages.github.com/versions/
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you have any plugins, put them here!
group :jekyll_plugins do
#  gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.6"
